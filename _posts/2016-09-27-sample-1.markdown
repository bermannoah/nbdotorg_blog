<img class="post-photo" alt="London in the sun, a Camden Town side-street" src="/assets/london.jpg">
<p>Five hours' New York jet lag and Cayce Pollard wakes in Camden town
to the dire and ever-circling wolves of disrupted circadian rhythm.</p>
<br />
<p>It is that flat and spectral non-hour, awash in limbic tides, brainstem 
stirring fitfully, flashing inappropriate reptilian demands for sex, food,
sedation, all of the above, and none really an option right now.</p>
<br />
<p>Not even food, as Damien's new kitchen is as devoid of edible content as
its designers' display windows in Camden High Street. Very handsome, the upper
cabinets faced in canary-yellow laminate, the lower with lacquered, unstained
apple-ply. Very clean and almost entirely empty, save for a carton containing
two dry pucks of Weetabix and some loose packets of herbal tea. Nothing at all
in the German fridge, so new that its interior smells only of cold and long-chain
monomers.</p>
<br />
<p>She knows, now, absolutely, hearing the white noise that is London, that
Damien's theory of jet lag is correct...</p>
